# Clippy
Clippy is a copying/pasting script designed to record and allow access to the last four entries of your clipboard.

Simply use the key stroke to copy text (CTRL/CMD + C) and it will be added to a list where you can access it later. The first copied text is associated with the first spot on the list, so to access the second copied item simply type ALT/CONTROL + 2 to place it in your clipboard. Then you may simply paste it (CTRL/CMD + V) to your desired location! To reset your list, type CTRL/CONTROL + ALT/CMD so that your next copied text will be the first item on the list. 
## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
## Usage
Use `python3 clippyMac.py` on command line or terminal to run the program
