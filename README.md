# Clippy
A copy and pasting extension done in python 3

Clippy is a copy and pasting extension designed for you to be able to copy and paste more than one item at a time. Clippy works be adding each item copied to your clipboard, to a file. Each copy takes up one line in the file, so to retrieve the copy all you have to do is press alt (control for mac) + the number line the copy is on (e.x. alt + 4) to copy the item to your clipboard. Then you can control (command for mac) + v to paste whatever is on your clipbaord. There are only four slots in the file to store items copied (more to come soon) and to clear the file you can press alt (control for mac) + control (command for mac).
